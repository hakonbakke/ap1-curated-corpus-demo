# Methodological Principles

This demo follows an **Honest Broker** approach to research synthesis
(Pielke, 2007).

The purpose is not to recommend a single solution, but to:
- structure available knowledge
- make disagreement visible
- clarify context and uncertainty
- expand the decision space for users

## Core principles

### 1. Human curation first
All documents are selected and justified by humans.
AI is never used to decide what enters the corpus.

### 2. Explicit inclusion logic
Each document includes a short explanation of **why it is included**
and what role it plays in the broader knowledge landscape.

### 3. Context before conclusions
Findings are always interpreted in light of:
- production stage
- system type
- geography
- time period

### 4. Disagreement is a feature, not a bug
Contradictory findings are preserved and highlighted,
not averaged away.

### 5. AI as assistant, not authority
AI is used to:
- retrieve relevant passages
- group findings
- support comparative analysis

Final interpretation and responsibility remain with humans.

## Transparency and accountability

All outputs are traceable to:
- specific documents
- specific sections
- explicit human decisions

This is essential for trust in contested policy and industry contexts.
