# Priority Questions – AP1 MVP

This repository follows the AP1 methodology proposed by Coffay et al.,
where **agreement on priority questions precedes corpus construction
and AI-supported synthesis**.

The purpose of these questions is not to produce single answers,
but to structure how evidence is selected, compared, and interpreted.

These questions define:
- what types of documents are included
- what contextual metadata is required
- how disagreement and uncertainty are surfaced

## Guiding principle

> We do not ask “what does the literature say in general?”
> We ask “what do we need to understand in order to inform decisions
> in a contested and context-dependent domain?”

## Priority questions (MVP scope)

### PQ1 – Relationship between delousing and mortality
Under what conditions is mechanical delousing associated with increased
mortality in Atlantic salmon, and where does the evidence diverge?

### PQ2 – Role of context and operational factors
How do system type, handling intensity, environmental conditions and
production stage influence post-delousing mortality outcomes?

### PQ3 – Distribution vs average effects
To what extent do average mortality estimates obscure variation and
tail-risk at cage or site level?

### PQ4 – Mechanisms and interpretation
What biological or welfare-related mechanisms are proposed to explain
observed mortality patterns, and where is the evidence indirect or uncertain?

## Scope and limitations

- These questions define the **initial MVP scope**
- The corpus is intentionally incomplete and will evolve as questions
  are refined or expanded
- The questions are expected to change over time; changes are tracked
  through repository version history

## Relationship to the corpus

Each document included in the AP1 corpus must:
- contribute evidence to at least one priority question
- have its relevance justified explicitly in metadata
- be interpretable within the context defined by these questions
