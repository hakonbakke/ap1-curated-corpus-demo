# AP1 Curated Corpus – MVP

This repository contains an **early MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** of a curated
research corpus developed in the context of Havbruksløftet AP1.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate — and actively test —
a transparent and methodologically robust way of building a shared knowledge base
in areas where scientific evidence is extensive, contested, and context-dependent.

The corpus is intentionally **small and incomplete**.
It will be expanded iteratively as part of ongoing work.

## What this repository is

- A **working MVP**, not a finished knowledge base
- A **curated corpus**, not a document dump
- A methodological foundation for AI-supported evidence synthesis
- Designed to surface **disagreement, context, and uncertainty**

## What this repository is NOT

- Not a full literature review
- Not a policy recommendation tool
- Not a production-ready RAG system
- Not claiming completeness or consensus

## Core principles

- Documents are **selected and justified by humans**
- Each document includes an explicit reason for inclusion
- AI is used only to support retrieval and comparison
- Final interpretation and responsibility remain with researchers

## Repository structure

- `METHOD.md` – methodological principles and researcher role
- `CORPUS_CRITERIA.md` – rules for including documents
- `documents/` – curated documents (PDF + text + metadata)
- `examples/` – examples of structured, honest-broker style synthesis

This repository is public to enable transparency and discussion,
but the corpus itself should be read as **work in progress**.
