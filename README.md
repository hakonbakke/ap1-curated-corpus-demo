# AP1 Curated Corpus – Demo

This repository is a **demonstration of method**, not a complete knowledge base.

It shows how a small, curated research corpus can be structured to support
transparent, evidence-based synthesis using AI — without hiding disagreement
or oversimplifying complex scientific questions.

The demo is inspired by the work in *Havbruksløftet AP1* and focuses on
**how knowledge is curated, structured, and used**, rather than on building
a full technical platform.
