# Corpus Inclusion Criteria

This MVP corpus is intentionally small and selective.

The goal is not completeness, but **representative coverage of key perspectives**
and areas of disagreement.

## Included document types

- Peer-reviewed scientific articles
- Public research reports (e.g. institutes, authorities)
- Widely cited project reports

## Excluded (in this demo)

- Media articles
- Opinion pieces
- Presentations without documented methods
- Internal or confidential material

## Minimum requirements

A document must:
- have a clear methodological basis or explicit experiential grounding
- be relevant to at least one core analytical question
- be dated and attributable

## Intentional balance

The corpus aims to include:
- studies pointing in different directions
- different system types and contexts
- both older and more recent work

This is done explicitly to avoid false consensus.
