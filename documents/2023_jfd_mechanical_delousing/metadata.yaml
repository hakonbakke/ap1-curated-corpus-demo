relevance_rationale: >
  Directly addresses post-treatment mortality patterns following mechanical delousing,
  central to the AP1 pilot question on lice and mortality.

quality_signal: medium

included_because: >
  Peer-reviewed observational study analysing mortality patterns following mechanical
  delousing under commercial conditions. Useful for contrasting treatment-related risk
  against alternative studies and for identifying contextual drivers (e.g., handling
  intensity and site conditions).

# Curator note: Pair with at least one study reporting lower/no mortality increase to surface disagreement.
# Curator note: Tag specific handling regime/intensity if extracted consistently across documents.

transferability: medium
transferability_notes: >
  Likely transferable to comparable open-cage systems, but outcomes may vary with handling intensity,
  environmental conditions, and operational practice.

key_claims:
  - "Mortality shows a measurable increase following mechanical delousing in the observed setting."
  - "Effects vary across sites/events, indicating strong contextual dependence."
