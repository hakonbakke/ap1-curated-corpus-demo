# PRIORITY QUESTIONS (Coffay Step 1 → drives corpus)
# =========================
priority_questions:
  - PQ1
  - PQ2
  - PQ4

question_contributions:
  PQ1:
    contribution: >
      Provides fish-level, cause-specific mortality evidence following mechanical
      delousing, documenting that mortality occurs in the period after the procedure.
  PQ2:
    contribution: >
      Establishes an empirically observed post-treatment risk window up to 13 days
      after delousing (based on repeated visits from 1 day before to 13 days after).
  PQ4:
    contribution: >
      Classifies causes of death using necropsy/macroscopic pathology and a uniform
      coding system, distinguishing injury/trauma-related mortality from other causes
      and highlighting misclassification in routine farm records.

# =========================
# RELEVANCE TO AP1 (human judgement)
# =========================
relevance:
  - lice
  - mechanical_delousing
  - mortality
  - cause_specific_mortality
  - welfare_injury_trauma

relevance_score: 5
relevance_rationale: >
  Central to the AP1 lice–mortality test case because it links mechanical delousing
  to post-treatment mortality using fish-level necropsy classification, and it shows
  that routine farm mortality recording may under-attribute deaths to injury/trauma.

study_type: "Field case study / observational (fish-level necropsy case series)"
production_stage: "Seawater grow-out"
system_type: "Open sea cages"
geography:
  country: "Norway"
  region: "unknown"

timeframe:
  data_years: "unknown (study visits reported relative to delousing event)"

  - mechanical

# =========================
# OUTCOMES (facts)
# =========================
primary_outcomes:
  - "Cause-specific fish-level mortality classification based on macroscopic pathology (necropsy)"
  - "Macroscopic pathological changes recorded at necropsy"
secondary_outcomes:
  - "Comparison between necropsy-based cause-of-death assignments and farmer daily mortality recordings"
  - "Occurrence of specific lesions (e.g., cerebral haemorrhage in peracute deaths)"

# =========================
# KEY FINDINGS (descriptive; avoid policy/overreach)
# =========================
key_findings:
  - "Mechanical delousing was followed by mortality and pathological changes observed up to 13 days post-procedure."
  - "Cerebral haemorrhages were identified in approximately 25% of necropsied fish that died peracutely."
  - "Farm daily mortality recordings attributed a smaller proportion of deaths to injury/trauma compared to necropsy-based classification."

# =========================
# EVIDENCE TYPE & LIMITATIONS (facts + bounded judgement)
# =========================
evidence_type:
  - "Fish-level necropsy with macroscopic pathology"
  - "Uniform code system applied to classify mortality/losses"
  - "Comparison against routine farm recording"

strengths:
  - "Fish-level, cause-specific mortality classification (not just counts)"
  - "Repeated sampling around the delousing event (pre to 13 days post)"
  - "Standardised coding approach enabling consistent classification"

limitations:
  - "Case study with limited number of sites/populations"
  - "Observational design; limited control of confounding factors"
  - "Findings may be context- and practice-dependent"

# =========================
# HUMAN INTERPRETATION (explicit; bounded)
# =========================
human_assessment:
  consensus_signal: context_dependent
  quality_signal: medium
  included_because: >
    Included as a key mechanistic/interpretive complement to mortality-rate studies.
    It provides structured cause-of-death classification after mechanical delousing,
    and demonstrates potential misclassification in routine farm mortality recording.

# Curator note:
# This paper is especially valuable paired with distributional mortality papers (e.g. JFD 2021)
# because it adds cause-of-death structure (injury/trauma vs other causes) rather than only rates.
