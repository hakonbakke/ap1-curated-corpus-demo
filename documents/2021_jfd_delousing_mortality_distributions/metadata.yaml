# RELEVANCE TO AP1 (human judgement)

relevance:
  - lice
  - delousing
  - mortality

relevance_score: 5
relevance_rationale: >
  Directly addresses post-delousing mortality at cage level and provides
  a quantitative framework for comparing mortality outcomes across different
  delousing treatments, central to the AP1 lice–mortality question.

# SYNTHESIS-LEVEL HUMAN ASSESSMENTS
# (do NOT come from the paper itself)
# --------------------------------------------------

consensus_signal: context_dependent
# Human judgement:
# Mortality outcomes vary by treatment type and context;
# the paper itself emphasises distributions rather than single effects.

quality_signal: strong
# Human judgement:
# Robust statistical modelling applied to large-scale industry data.

# INCLUSION LOGIC (critical human decision)
# --------------------------------------------------

included_because: >
  Peer-reviewed observational study providing a statistically robust
  analysis of cage-level mortality distributions following different
  delousing treatments. Included as a key quantitative reference that
  complements mechanistic and welfare-focused studies and is frequently
  cited in discussions on treatment-related mortality risk.


# --------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL CURATOR ASSESSMENTS
# --------------------------------------------------

quality_rationale: >
  Large dataset with appropriate statistical modelling of mortality
  distributions. While observational, the analytical approach allows
  meaningful comparison across treatment categories.

transferability: medium
transferability_notes: >
  Results are highly relevant to Norwegian open-cage production systems.
  Transferability to other regulatory or operational contexts should be
  assessed with caution.

coi_declared: unclear
coi_notes: >
  Funding sources and conflict-of-interest statements should be checked
  and updated explicitly if required.

# KEY CLAIMS (human-formulated, neutral)
# --------------------------------------------------

key_claims:
  - "Cage-level mortality following delousing shows substantial variation across treatment types."
  - "Mortality outcomes are better described by distributions than by single average values."
  - "Contextual and operational factors strongly influence post-treatment mortality risk."

# FREE-FORM CURATOR COMMENTS

# Curator note:
# This paper is well suited for pairing with:
# - 2023 JFD studies focusing on post-treatment mortality dynamics, and
# - experimental/welfare studies explaining physiological mechanisms.
