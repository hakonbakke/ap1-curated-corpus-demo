# Summary

This study analyses cage-level mortality distributions in Atlantic salmon
following different delousing treatments under commercial farming conditions
in Norway.

Rather than focusing on average mortality outcomes, the authors model the
full distribution of post-treatment mortality at cage level, allowing
comparison across treatment categories and highlighting variability
between cages and events.

## Data and approach

- Based on large-scale industry data from Norwegian salmon farming
- Observational design using registered mortality data
- Mortality outcomes analysed as distributions rather than single-point estimates
- Delousing treatments grouped by treatment category

## Key findings (excerpted)

- Cage-level mortality following delousing shows substantial variation
  across treatment types
- Some treatments are associated with higher probability of extreme
  mortality events
- Average mortality values mask important differences in risk profiles
  between treatments

## Interpretation and context

- The study does not attribute causality, but identifies statistically
  meaningful differences in mortality distributions
- Results emphasise the importance of considering variability and tail risk,
  not only mean effects
- Findings are specific to Norwegian open-cage production systems

## Limitations

- Observational design limits causal inference
- Potential confounding factors (e.g. fish condition, environment,
  handling intensity) cannot be fully isolated
- Results may not directly transfer to non-Norwegian or non–open-cage systems

## Notes for corpus use

This paper is particularly useful for:
- Quantitative comparison of mortality outcomes across delousing methods
- Demonstrating why single average mortality estimates can be misleading
- Complementing mechanistic and welfare-focused studies that explore
  underlying biological explanations
